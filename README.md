A simple yet modern **URL Shortener** built with the MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js and TypeScript.  
TinyUrl allows users to shorten long links, manage them through an authenticated dashboard, and view detailed analytics, all wrapped in a clean and minimal UI.

## How It Works

TinyUrl takes a **long, complex URL** and generates a **short, unique code** using a random string generator stored in MongoDB.  
Each short link is associated with its original URL, metadata, and analytics records.

When a user visits a short link:

1. The backend looks up the short code in MongoDB.
2. The original long URL is retrieved.
3. A click log is added (IP address, timestamp).
4. The user is redirected to the destination instantly.

All user actions (creating, editing, deleting, tracking URLs) are protected by **JWT-based authentication** ensuring secure and isolated data per user.

### Short URL Generation Logic

This is the fun part, the little ‚Äúbrain‚Äù behind TinyUrl.  
I wanted to have a bit _chaotic_ logic, and this chaoticness makes logic unpridictable, irreversable.

So here‚Äôs what actually happens under the hood:

<div style="width : 650px; margin: auto; display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;">
<figure >
  <picture>
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/diagrams/flow-dark.png" />
    <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/diagrams/flow-light.png" />
    <img src="assets/diagrams/flow-light.png" alt="Flow Diagram" />
  </picture>
</figure>
</div>

1. **A seed number** is created using the current timestamp
   specifically `Date.now() % 10000`.

   > Why modulo 10000? Because we only need a small, ever-changing seed.  
   > The clock does half the randomness for us.

2. This seed is then converted into a **Base62 string**:

   Base62 is generated from the characters: "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"

   > Why not base64 ? Because base64 includes **+** and **/** , they messup when placed in a URL.

3. Instead of directly using that Base62 value, it‚Äôs passed through an **HMAC-SHA256** hashing process using a secret key.

- This step makes each output **non-predictable**.
- Even if two users generate URLs at the same second, the HMAC ensures a unique twist.
- Also‚Ä¶ adding cryptography just felt _coool_.

4. From the resulting hash, I extract a **substring from the middle** ,
   because, well, why not make the logic slightly mysterious?  
   It‚Äôs a deliberate design choice to make reverse-engineering the pattern _nearly impossible_. üòé
5. Finally, that substring becomes the short code: **xYz12**

Each short code is unique enough for small-scale use, unpredictable to humans, and a fun playground for experimenting with crypto-based randomness.
